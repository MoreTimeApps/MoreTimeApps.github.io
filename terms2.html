or otherwise legally protectable elements of the Services, including, without limitation the 'look and feel'
and arrangement of items, and all trademarks, service marks and trade names related thereto
(individually or collectively, “<b>Protected Content</b>”). Except as permitted by us herein and without
derogating from the generality of these Terms, you may not copy, download, stream capture, reproduce,

Note that some of the Apps make use of the Android accessibility services feature in order to enable you to close multiple apps running in the background on your device in order to improve device performance, without requiring you to do so for each app individually, which may be difficult for users, particularly those with mobility disabilities. By default, push notifications may be sent to you, to inform you
of any Service-related matters. If you wish to opt-out from receiving these types of communications, you
may turn them off at the device level. </p>
